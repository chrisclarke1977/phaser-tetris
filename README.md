# phaser-tetris
my own efforts at learning how to use phaser

From the blog by photon storm I have been inspired to try and use the phaser game engine to create a tetris game.

## TODO: 
* Place tets on the board
* Wall block the tets
* Fix Pause state
* Dump old tets on board

## Done:
* States - Pause has issues
* Make tets move
* Make tets rotate
* Make tets drop
